## Introduction to API3 for Eth Zurich hackers 

Zürich is one of the last European cities that hasn't had a major Ethereum focused event despite its clear importance within the Ethereum 

API3 is happy to be delivering a bounty challenge as part of the weekend, and welcome hackers to participate in the challenge whilst learning more about first-party oracles! 

If you haven't already, make sure to familairize yourself with the Ethereum Zurich hacker manuel: https://zurich.utxo.foundation/#hackathon-themes

### Understanding API3

[API3]() is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the [API3 DAO]().

An Airnode is a first-party oracle that pushes off-chain API data to your on-chain contract. Airnode is a serverless function that lets API providers easily run their own oracle nodes. That way, they can provide data to any on-chain dApp that's interested in their services without an intermediary.

### API3 Datafeeds

API3 uses first-party oracles to power [dAPIs](). dAPIs are secure, transparent, and cost-efficient data feeds that connect smart contracts directly to first-party data sources.

Self-funded dAPIs give DeFi builders access to real-time market data through on 10 networks and 11 testnets.

### QRNG - API3's Quantum Random Number Generator

API3 QRNG is a public utility we provide with the courtesy of Australian National University (ANU). It is powered by an Airnode hosted by ANU Quantum Random Numbers, meaning that it is a first-party service. It is served as a public good and is free of charge (apart from the gas costs), and it provides ‘true’ quantum randomness via an easy-to-use solution when requiring RNG on-chain.

## Hackathon Challenge

Participants are free to build a decentralized application that demonstrates the use of API3’s first-party oracles.

- Participants can build dApps that use dAPIs, Airnode, or QRNG that facilitate a proper use-case.

- Participants are free to implement their own ideas.

### Potential Ideas

- Prediction market
- Lending application
- Perpetual swaps 
- Derivative protocols 
- P2P transactional bots
- Decentralized insurance protocols
- Algorithmic stablecoin

## Judging criteria

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. After submission, projects will be judged by the following criteria:

- **Real-world Functionality**: How well does the project work? Does it meet the minimum requirements?

- **Technical Difficulty**: How technically challenging was it to build the project?

- **Originality**: How original is the idea? How much does it differ from other existing solutions?

- **Design**: How well designed is the project? Is it easy to use? Is it visually appealing?

- **BONUS** - Adding functionality to the Airnode protocol that will improve performance, interoperability, or further develop use cases.

After judges complete the evaluations, the top 3 projects will be selected based on their weighted scores to receive prizes. Winners will be announced shortly after the hackathon ends.
